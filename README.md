This is a story with a background setting for a fairly near, non-dystopian future. Mix in elements of augmented reality, hacking, inevitable changes to the world's ecosystems, governments, balances of socioeconomic power, AI, robots, cybernetic enhancements, elements from esoteric spiritual traditions that suggest the potential of humans to gain superhuman abilities and you have a reasonably near life explanation of scifi and fantasy. Instead of calling powers 'magic' or a result of mutation they are created from the refinement of human capacity. Gameplay can become immersive when adding biosensors to the person and changing character status and abilities based on the readout of those biosensors. So the game can teach and reward meditation states within action (this is why martial arts was always considered a spiritual practice), postural improvement, and even reward things such as paying more attention to homeostatic balance. In this way a video game can emulate high performance athleticism by gamifying peak personal health.
